`This is on-going project` 
My lunch project's purpose is quite simple. I always check weekly menu table for cafeteria in my office building. It is uploaded every Monday morning. 
How about make this process as a program, then I don't have to go the website for the image. 
This project just got started, so I only have my rough thoughts. Will append more details later.
